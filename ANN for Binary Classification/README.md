# Shallow Neural Network from Scratch

## Description

I build a binary classification from scratch using Neural Network with one hidden layer, also known as Shallow Neural Network.
This project use data from `sklearn.datasets` to get labeled data (0 or 1) with 2 features, and plot a decision boundary using the usual `matplotlib.pyplot`.

For the achitecture itself, we will use 2 neuron (or nodes) on the input layer, 4 neuron on the hidden layer, and 1 neuron on the output layer. We also use sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent
as our activation function.

I also use various package such as:

- numpy, of course
- scikit-learn, to acquire the data
- matplotlib, for the visualization

This code is not the best, and there's still a lot room for improvement. Especially turning this code into OOP for more practical purposes.

## Disclaimer
I ~~steal~~ gain inspiration from some code on google and my professor at uni. This project is intended for my personal learning.
